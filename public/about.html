<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> My name is Marcus Searles. My journey into learning web development and coding up to this point in my life has been an unpredictable and challenging one.
  Before I started learning about web development, I was studying to become a Data Analyst which I have taken an online course and received a certificate.
  Data analytics was a field that truly interest me in which I wanted to start my career in this field but it had some drawbacks due to the fact I wasn't able to land a junior level job to help me gain work experience.
  I was disappointed for a while because my current circumstances in life doesn't allow me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in computer science, but deep down I felt like there is another route I can take for my situation. 
  The Google Data Analytics program did provide me with some hands on training in working with SQL, R Studio, analyzing data with spreadsheets, and using data visualization tools like Tableau. 
  This exposure to different programming languages had spark another interest in wanting to sharpen my skill set in coding and web development. 
 </p>

<p> Now there is a fork in the road on where I needed to make a decision on how to learn web development and where to go to gain that knowledge and training. 
  I knew that enrolling in a Bachelor's degree wasn't an option for me, so I have searched tirelessly on the internet for reputable online certifications or bootcamps that would fit my situation and that is where I was able to find a Web Developer Bootcamp that fits my needs.
  So far in the bootcamp program, I'm learning a lot about HTML, CSS, Javascript and the importance of understanding your code and how it relates to the big picture in building a website. 
  I know I still have a long way to go in becoming an expert in this field of web development,
  and there will be dark days ahead of trial and errors, feeling lost, becoming stuck on projects, or even days on where I want to give up on it all. 
  On the contrary, that's the moment to keep a fresh perspective, take a step back, and reflect on the big picture on how a project will both a company and the team.

<p> This point in my life, I do not know where this training and education will lead me down the road but my main goal is to gain as much experience in learning code as possible.
  I want to be confident in writing my code to the point on where I can understand it fluently, fix an error on my code or someone else code, and not being afraid to make mistakes when they do occur. 
I see myself as a creative person who thinks out of the box and I'm ready to take on this challenge of being a web developer so I can see what possibilities are out there as I create and design websites.    </p>
